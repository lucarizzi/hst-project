This python procedure allows you to interactively select a (rectangular) region of an image to perform a fit to. This is useful for situations where the galaxy does not take up the whole field, as well as those where you would like to avoid a selection of blue stars (spiral arms for instance). This thereby reduces contamination. 





The python TRGB tool then takes this text file and uses it to select stars (as can be seen in the third cell of its jupyter notebook).
